When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In order to share your code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because other users might also change something on the remote repository which you do not want to have.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a clone of a repository of somebody else on Github. A clone is a local copy of another repository. Finally a branch is another development path in a repository.
